            (General Mobile Radio Service) before, no worries, most people
            haven't. Up until this year, I wasn't familiar with it either. I
            somewhat stumbled upon this obscured technology through listening to
            an episode of
            <a href="https://podcast.asknoahshow.com/" target="_blank"
              >Ask Noah Show</a
            >
            a few years back.<br /><br />I don't remember what the episode was
            about, only that Noah was saying something about "ham" radio. He
            later went on to talk about the perks of being an amateur radio
            operator and a particular situation where it helped him get out of a
            pickle. By the end of the episode, I think I already had a BaoFeng
            UV-5R radio in my Amazon cart and a new hobby in the making.<br /><br />Fast
            forward a couple of years later, and still now license. My ambitious
            attempt to become an amateur radio operator was short-lived and put
            on the back burner. My radio was now mostly a geeky decoration and
            the occasional flashlight when a storm would take out the
            electricity.<br /><br />Now comes the year 2020, the "Karen" of all
            years. And, right before the pandemic (COVID-19) started to catch
            fire, my wife and I bought our first home in a small HOA
            neighborhood in La Porte, TX. If you have never heard or been to
            this area, it's adjacent to the bay and partially surrounded by
            refineries and chemical plants.
