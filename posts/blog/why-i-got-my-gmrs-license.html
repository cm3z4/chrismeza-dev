            (General Mobile Radio Service) before, no worries, most people
            haven't. Up until the year 2020, I wasn't familiar with it either. I
            somewhat stumbled upon this obscured technology through listening to
            an episode of
            <a

              >Ask Noah Show</a

            a few years back.

            <br /><br />

            I don't remember what the episode was about, only that Noah was
            saying something about "ham radio" (amateur radio). He later went on
            to talk about the perks of being a ham radio operator and a
            particular situation where his radio helped get him out of a jam. By
            the end of the episode, I think I already had a BaoFeng UV-5R radio
            in my Amazon cart and a new hobby in the making.

            <br /><br />

            Fast forward a couple of years later, and still no license. My
            ambitious attempt to become a ham radio operator was short-lived and
            put on the back burner. My radio was now mostly a geeky decoration
            and the occasional flashlight when a storm would take out the power.

            <br /><br />

            Now comes the year 2020, the "Karen" of all years. And, right before
            the pandemic (COVID-19) started to wreak havoc, my wife and I bought
            our very first suburban home in La Porte, Texas. If you've never
            heard of the place, it's mostly adjacent to the bay and partially
            surrounded by refineries and chemical plants. So, there is a ton of
            radio traffic.

            <br /><br />

            Now to the point of this story. After the painfully tedious process
            of unpacking, I began tinkering with my radio again. I started
            scanning through frequencies, and to my surprise, a lot of voices
            started resonating through my radio's speaker. It didn't take me
            long to figure out that I was listening to a nearby GMRS repeater.

            <br /><br />

            After a few weeks of monitoring radio chatter in the background, my
            curiosity finally got the best of me. One day, I overheard two guys
            trying to troubleshoot a Linux printing issue. I wanted so badly to
            help, but I didn't have a license to transmit. So, I did a little
            research and applied for one a day or so later. It didn't take long
            for the FCC to process my application and assign me a call sign.

            <br /><br />

            Since then, I've bought a couple of radios and even installed an
            external antenna on my roof. I still plan to get my amateur radio
            license, but for now, I'm happy with the GMRS community.

            For anyone just starting like me, you have nothing to lose. It's fun
            and relatively affordable. Not to mention the benefits it would have
            during a global disaster or zombie apocalypse. While GMRS isn't
            amateur radio, it's not far from it. Unlike ham radio, you don't
            have to take an exam to get licensed for GMRS. So, don't
            procrastinate as I did. Get licensed and start having some fun.

            73 for now. WRKD233, clear and standing by.
